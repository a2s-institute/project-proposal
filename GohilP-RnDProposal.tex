\chapter{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
%	Introduction to the general topic i'm covering
    \item The environment that we experience is multimodal because we use visual, audio, touch, taste and smell sensory information. A very good example could be a person talking to someone will combine audio (voice) with the visual (lips movement) information to understand them better
    \item The Autonomous mobile robot is equipped with multiple sensors with which they measures different aspect of its environment and perform various task. 
    \item Multiple sensors on autonomous mobile robot measures the different information of the same environment. For example, multiple sensors can capture the occurrence of an event. Let us consider an event where robot accidentally dropping an object. The tactile, vision, audio sensors give some information about the same event. Combined representation of the event from multiple sources of input is called multimodality.
    \item According to Merriam Webster, vision is the prime part of sensation in modality.
    \item We focus to combine, process and relate multiple sensory modalities using machine learning techniques to solve a certain task in the field of robotics. Our primary focus is on combining visual information with other sensory data.
    \item Developing such a model can help to correlate visual information with multiple other modalities from robot sensors to understand the robot's environment better and increase the performance.
    \item Usually, different tasks in robotics are solved with single modality. A computer vision techniques are applied on visual sensory information. Signal processing and filtering is used for audio and tactile sensor data. However, information available from one sensor is processed independent of other sensor data. Where we are missing correlation between different sensor information while processing.

    \item The approach can help robot to understand it's environment better or accurately given a particular task.
	\item It can be applied to follow ing task performed by the robot,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pick and place task
		\item Fault detection and diagnosis
		\item Audio-Visual Speech recognition
		\item Event recognition
	\end{itemize}
	\item Other than Robotics, multimodal machine learning can also be used for,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In the medical field such as neuroimaging to fuse data from EEG, MEG, MRI and increase the performance of diagnosis \cite{Daehne2015}.
		\item Media captioning
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Project Plan}

\section{Work Packages}
The bare minimum will include the following packages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[WP1] Literature Search
    \item[WP2] Experiments
    \item[WP3] Project Report
\end{enumerate}
Keep in mind that depending on your project, you will probably need to add work packages that are more suited to your projects.

\section{Milestones}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[M1] Literature search
    \item[M2] Experimental setup
    \item[M3] Experimental Analysis
    \item[M4] Report submission
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Schedule}
Include a gantt chart here. It doesn't have to be detailed, but it should include the milestones you mentioned above.
Make sure to include the writing of your report throughout the whole project, not just at the end.
